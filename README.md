# SEC Calibration

Calibration of the Scintillation Electromagnetic Calorimeter.

The electromagnetic calorimeter is used for measurement of photons emission angles and energies. 

In order to optimize the photons four-momenta reconstruction, the energy calibration was carried out based on determination of the invariant mass of neutral pions. 
For this purpose events with exactly two neutral clusters in the Central Detector were selected and considered as originating from gamma quanta. 
In order to apply a global correction for initial calibration, the distribution of invariant mass of two gamma quanta for whole data sample was reconstructed. 
The signal was fitted with a Novosibirsk function, and the background was fitted as a seven degree polynomial. 
The deviation from the actual invariant mass of pion was used to set the values of the calibration factor, being the ratio of energy for gamma quanta after applied correction to uncorrected energy. 
The calibration correction factor was applied for each CsI crystal of the calorimeter.
